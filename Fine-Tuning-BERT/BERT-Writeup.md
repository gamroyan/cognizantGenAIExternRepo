# Fine-Tuning BERT Project with HuggingFace
This project fine-tunes a ```bert-base-uncased``` model for binary sentiment classification on the IMDb movie review dataset using the HuggingFace Transformers library.

## Part 1: Fine-Tuning BERT
**NLP Task:** sentiment analysis

**Model:** ```BertForSequenceClassification``` for binary classification

**Training Arguments:** specified hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, and logging settings.

**Training:** Used Hugging Face's ```Trainer``` API to set up a training loop for training and evaluation of the model.

### Files
- ```fine_tuning_bert.py```: main script to tokenize data, fine-tune BERT, and evaluate the model.
- ```results/```: contains training checkpoints and logs

### Results
**TO-DO

## Part 2: Debugging Issues

## Part 3: Evaluating the Model

## Part 4: Creative Application
